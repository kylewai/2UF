# 2UF
Senior project

  This project is a scheduling mobile app. It is designed as a tool to help UF students to
create their schedules during the registration period.
In developing this mobile app, we targeted the Android platform using native Android.
We used the free, NoSQL database Cloud Firestore provided by the Firebase development
platform as our backend to store and retrieve user data. At completion of this project, we were
able to implement all the features we planned. There is still work to be done to implement
features that improve the usefulness of the forum, including replies to comments and direct user-user messaging. Without connection to the UF system, certain features such as the display of the userâ€™s real schedule remain a proof-of-concept implementation.
